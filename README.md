# Scheduling-CSP-Solver

The basic setting of the problem: 

- There are two academic terms and each term has courses that run either MWF (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) or TTH (Tuesday/Thursday).
- Only 5 courses (e.g. 3 MWF, 2 TTH) are available per each term.
- The student has already completed MATH 134 before to prove prerequisite_constraint_transitive (e.g. CMPUT 204 requires MATH 134 or MATH 144, CMPUT 366 requires CMPUT 204).
- The same room can be used for only 2 courses.
